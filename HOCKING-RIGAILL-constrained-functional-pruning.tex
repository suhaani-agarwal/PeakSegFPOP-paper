\begin{abstract}
  Change-point detection is a central problem in time series and
  genomic data sets. In several kinds of data it is desirable to
  constrain the possible change-points to obtain a more interpretable
  model. We propose a new constrained Pruned Dynamic Programming
  Algorithm (cPDPA) which recovers the optimal change-points subject
  to affine constraints on adjacent segment means. We use this
  algorithm for isotonic regression and peak detection.

\section{Introduction}

Change-point detection is a central problem in many fields. When there
are no constraints other than the number of change-points or segments,
the Pruned Dynamic Programming Algorithm (PDPA) can be used to recover
the change-points with minimum cost \citep{pruned-dp}. The Functional
Pruning Optimal Partitioning (FPOP) algorithm can be used when there
is no constraint on the number of change-points, but there is a
positive penalty constant \citep{FPOP}. 

In the unconstrained change-point detection model, there is no
constraint on the direction of changes that can be recovered. However,
in several kinds of data it is desirable to constrain the possible
change-points to obtain a more interpretable model. For example, in
genomic data it is desirable to only consider models that can be
easily interpreted in terms of peaks and background
\citep{PeakSeg}. This amounts to forcing an up change after each down
change, and vice versa.

The isotonic regression problem is another example of constrained
change-point detection. Typically there is no limit on the number of
changes, as long as they are all in the same direction. This problem
can be solved using the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm
\citep{mair2009isotone}. An L1 relaxed version of this problem is
nearly-isotonic regression \citep{tibshirani2011nearly}.

TODO discuss isotonic DP \citep{isotonic-dp}, functional pruning
\citep{phd-johnson}, reduced isotonic regression
\citep{hardwick2014optimal}, unimodal segmentation
\citep{haiminen2008algorithms}, histogram construction
\citep{halim2009fast}.

\subsection{Contributions}

The main contribution of this paper is a family of algorithms for
solving constrained segmentation problems. These algorithms are
guaranteed to recover the exact solution to the constrained
segmentation problem. Furthermore, we show that these algorithms have
empirical time complexity which is linear in the number of data
points.

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related}

The models we consider in this paper are constrained versions of the
optimal segmentation model \citep{Segmentor}. The
unconstrained model can be computed using a dynamic programming
algorithm (DPA) \citep{bellman}, or a pruned dynamic programming
algorithm (pDPA) \citep{pruned-dp}. Both algorithms are guaranteed to
recover the exact solution to the unconstrained model, but there are
two important differences. The pDPA is more complicated to implement,
but is also computationally faster than the DPA. For segmenting a
sequence of $d$ data points, the pDPA takes on average $O(d\log d)$
time whereas the DPA takes $O(d^2)$ time.

The constraints that we consider in this paper are a generalization of
the peak detection model \citep{PeakSeg} and the isotonic regression
model \citep{isotonic}. Rather than searching all possible
change-points to find the most likely model with $s$ segments, we
propose to constrain the possible change-points so that the segment
means may be more easily interpreted.

\section{From unconstrained to constrained maximum likelihoood
  segmentation}
\label{sec:model}

In this section we first discuss the existing unconstrained maximum
likelihood model, and then we discuss a more general framework for
constrained maximum likelihood segmentation.

\subsection{Unconstrained maximum likelihood segmentation}

For a sequence of $d$ data points $\mathbf y\in\ZZ_+^d$ to segment, we
fix a maximum number of segments $ s_{\text{\text{max}}}\leq d$. The
unconstrained maximum likelihood segmentation model is defined as the
most likely mean vector $\mathbf m\in\RR^d$ with $s\in\{1, 2, \dots,
s_{\max}\}$ piecewise constant segments:
\begin{align}
  \label{unconstrained}
  \mathbf{\hat m}^s(\mathbf y)  =\ 
  &\argmin_{\mathbf m\in\RR^{d}} && 
  \ell
  %\tag{\textbf{Unconstrained}}
  (\mathbf m, \mathbf y) \\
  &\text{such that} && \Segments(\mathbf m)=s,
  \nonumber
\end{align}
where the Poisson loss function is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:loss}
  \ell(\mathbf m, \mathbf y)= \sum_{j=1}^d m_j - y_j \log m_j.
\end{equation} 
The model complexity is the number of piecewise constant segments
\begin{equation}
  \Segments(\mathbf m)=1+\sum_{j=2}^d I(m_j \neq m_{j-1}),
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the indicator function. 

Although it is a non-convex optimization problem, the sequence of
segmentations $\mathbf{\hat m}^1(\mathbf y), \dots, \mathbf{\hat
  m}^{s_{\text{\text{max}}}}(\mathbf y)$ can be computed in
$O(s_{\text{\text{max}}} d^2)$ time using dynamic programming
\citep{bellman}, or in $O(s_{\text{\text{max}}} d \log d)$
time using pruned dynamic programming \citep{pruned-dp, Segmentor}.

We refer to (\ref{unconstrained}) as the ``unconstrained'' model
since $\mathbf{\hat m}^s(\mathbf y)$ is the most likely segmentation
of all possible models with $s$ piecewise constant segments ($s-1$
change-points). Several unconstrained models are shown on the left of
Figure~\ref{fig:Segmentor-PeakSeg}, and for example the second segment
of the model with $s=3$ segments appears to capture the peak in the
data.
% In general, we would like to use the 2nd, 4th,
% ... segments as peaks, and the 1st, 3rd, ... segments as
% background. 
To construct a peak detector $c$, we first define the peak indicator at base
$j\in\{2, \dots, d\}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:peaks}
  P_j(\mathbf m) = \sum_{k=2}^j \sign( m_{k} - m_{k-1} ),
\end{equation}
where $P_1(\mathbf m)=0$ by convention. $P_j(\mathbf m)$ is the
cumulative sum of signs of changes up to point $j$ in the piecewise
constant vector $\mathbf m$. We define the vector of peak indicators
as
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf
P[\mathbf m] = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} P_1(\mathbf m) & \cdots &
    P_d(\mathbf m)
\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}

\subsection{PeakSeg: constrained maximum likelihood}
\label{sec:constrained}

In general for the unconstrained model $P_j(\mathbf m)\in\ZZ$, which
is problematic since we want to use it as a peak detector with binary
outputs $P_j(\mathbf m)\in \{0, 1\}$. 

For example, if $\mathbf m = \left[\begin{array}{ccccccc}1.1 &
    1.1 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 3\end{array}\right]$, with two changes up
followed by one change down, then $\mathbf P(\mathbf m) =
\left[\begin{array}{ccccccc}0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 &
    1 \end{array}\right]$.

% This is also a practical problem that can be observed in real data
% sets. For example in Figure~\ref{fig:Segmentor-PeakSeg} there is a position $j$ for
% which $P_j\left[ \mathbf{\hat m}^5(\mathbf y) \right]=2$ (since the
% mean changes up, up, down, down). 

Thus we constrain the peak indicator $P_j(\mathbf
m)\in\{0, 1\}$, which results
in the constrained problem
\begin{align*}
  \label{PeakSeg}
  \mathbf{\tilde m}^s(\mathbf y)  =
    \argmin_{\mathbf m\in\RR^{d}} &\ \ 
    \rho(\mathbf m, \mathbf y) 
    \tag{\textbf{PeakSeg}}
\\
    \text{such that} &\ \  \Segments(\mathbf m)=s,  \\
     \forall j\in\{1, \dots, d\}, &\ \ P_j(\mathbf m) \in\{0, 1\}.
\end{align*}
Note that one must specify the number of segments $s$ or,
equivalently, the number of peaks $p=(s-1)/2$. Another way to
interpret the constrained \ref{PeakSeg} problem is that the sequence
of changes in the segment means $\mathbf m$ must begin with a positive
change and then alternate: up, down, up, down, ... (and not up, up,
down). Thus the even-numbered segments may be interpreted as peaks
$P_j(\mathbf m)=1$, and the odd-numbered segments may be interpreted
as background $P_j(\mathbf m)=0$.

For example, the good peaks in Figure~\ref{fig:good-bad} are the
second and fourth segments of the \ref{PeakSeg} solution for $s=5$
segments.

Figure~\ref{fig:Segmentor-PeakSeg} shows a profile where the constraint is
necessary for the even-numbered segments to be interpreted as
peaks. In particular, it is clear that unconstrained models with
$s\in\{5, 7\}$ segments do not satisfy $P_j[\mathbf{\hat m}^s(\mathbf
y)]\in\{0, 1\}$ for all positions $j\in\{1,\dots, d\}$ (since they
have up, up, down changes).

\section{Algorithm}

\subsection{Constrained PeakSeg model}

For the Segment Neighborhood algorithm we begin as usual by computing
a functional representation of the optimal cost in 1 segment up to
base $b$. 
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:C1b}
  C_{1,b}(\mu) = \sum_{i=1}^b \gamma_b(\mu),
\end{equation*}
where $\gamma_b(\mu)$ is the cost of using the mean $\mu$ for single
data point $b$ (for example the Gaussian or Poisson loss).

Next we define the minimum cost in 2 segments up to data point 2 as
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:C22}
  C_{2,2}(\mu) = C_{1,1}^{\leq}(\mu) + \gamma_2(\mu),
\end{equation*}
where for a function $f:\RR\rightarrow\RR$ the min-less operator
yields another function $f\leq:\RR\rightarrow\RR$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:min-less}
  f^{\leq}(\mu) = \min_{x\leq \mu} f(x).
\end{equation}
The algorithm relies on the ability to compute an exact representation
of functions such as $C_{1,1}^{\leq}$. Since the cost functions $f$
are quasiconvex, we can easily find the minimum $\mu^*$, and then
compute the following exact representation
\begin{equation*}
  f^\leq(\mu)
  \begin{cases}
    f(\mu^*) & \text{ if } \mu \geq \mu^*,\\
    f(\mu) & \text{ otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \parbox{3in}{
    \begin{center}
    \input{figure-1-min-more-operator}
    \end{center}
  }
  \parbox{3in}{
    \begin{center}
      \input{figure-1-min-less-operator}
    \end{center}
  }
  \caption{\label{fig:min-operators} \textbf{Left:} The min-more
    operator is $C^{\geq}(\mu)=\min_{x\geq \mu}C(x)$. \textbf{Right:}
    The min-less operator is $C^{\leq}(\mu)=\min_{x\leq
      \mu}C(x)$.}
\end{figure}

The next step is to compute the minimum cost in 2 segments up to data
point 3, for which there is a choice of two change-points.
\begin{equation*}
  C_{2,3}(\mu) = \min
  \begin{cases}
    C_{2,2}(\mu)+\gamma_3(\mu), \\
    C_{1,2}^{\leq}(\mu)+\gamma_3(\mu)
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
We have already computed an exact representation of the $C_{2,2}$
term, which is the cost a change after the first data point. Now we
need to compare it with the $C_{1,2}^{\leq}$ term, which is the cost
of a change after the second data point. This is a crucial step in
which the \texttt{MinEnvelope} sub-routine computes an exact
representation of the minimum of these two functions.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \begin{center}
    \input{figure-2-min-envelope}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\label{fig:min-envelope} The cost $C_{s,t}$ in $s$ segments
    up to $t$ data points is computed using the min envelope
    $M_{s,t-1}$. \textbf{Left:} the min envelope for $s=3$ segments up
    to data point $t=34$ is the minimum of two functions:
    $C^{\geq}_{2,34}$ is the cost if the second segment ends at data
    point $t=34$, and $C_{3,34}$ is the cost if the second segment
    ends before that. \textbf{Middle:} the optimal cost for $s=3$
    segments up to data point $t=35$ is the sum of the min envelope
    $M_{3,34}$ and the cost of the next data point
    $\gamma_{35}$. \textbf{Right:} in the next step, the
    algorithm prunes all previously considered change-points (cost
    $C_{3,35}$), and only considers the model with a the second segment
    ending at data point $t=35$ (cost $C^{\geq}_{2,35}$).}
\end{figure}

The updates continue for every data point $b\in\{3, ..., B\}$
\begin{equation*}
  C_{2,b}(\mu) = \min
  \begin{cases}
    C_{2,b-1}(\mu) + \gamma_b(\mu),\\
    C_{1,b-1}^{\leq}(\mu) + \gamma_b(\mu).
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

For the third segment we first compute the minimum cost up to data point 3
\begin{equation*}
  C_{3,3}(\mu) = C_{2,2}^{\geq}(\mu) + \gamma_3(\mu),
\end{equation*}
where the more-min operator $f^\geq$ is defined analogously. The
update formula for the minimum cost up to data point
$b\in\{4, ..., B\}$ is
\begin{equation*}
  C_{3,b}(\mu) = \min
  \begin{cases}
    C_{3,b-1}^{\geq}(\mu)+\gamma_b(\mu),\\
    C_{2,b-1}^{\geq}(\mu)+\gamma_b(\mu)
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
In general for $s$ segments, we use
\begin{equation}
  C_{s,s}(\mu) = C_{s-1,s-1}^{*}(\mu) + \gamma_s(\mu),
\end{equation}
and for $b\in\{s+1, ..., B\}$
\begin{equation}
  C_{s,b}(\mu) = \min
  \begin{cases}
    C_{s,b-1}^{*}(\mu)+\gamma_b(\mu),\\
    C_{s-1,b-1}^{*}(\mu)+\gamma_b(\mu),
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where * means less-min for even-numbered segments $s$, and more-min
for odd-numbered segments.

\subsection{Example of algorithm on a small data set}

In this section we analyze the data
$\mathbf z = \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 10 & 14 & 13
\end{array}\right]\in\ZZ_+^4
$. For $s=3$ segments there are only 3 possible segmentations:
$[1][10][14, 13]$, $[1][10, 14][13]$ and $[1, 10][14][13]$. If we use
max-likelihood estimates for each segment mean, then only the last
segmentation obeys the \ref{PeakSeg} model constraints
($\mathbf m =\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 5.5 & 5.5 & 14 &
    13\end{array}\right]$). However using the square loss, this model
has a cost of 40.5, which is clearly not optimal. For example the
model
$\mathbf m =\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 13 & 13 &
    12\end{array}\right]$ has a lower cost of only 11. In fact the
constrained PDPA recovers the optimal model
$\mathbf m =\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 37/3 & 37/3 &
    37/3\end{array}\right]$ which has a cost of $26/3\approx
8.67$. Since the strict inequality is not satisfied (the second and
third segment means are exactly equal), this model is not feasible for
the \ref{PeakSeg} problem. For these data, the minimum of the
\ref{PeakSeg} problem (with strict inequality constraints) is
undefined.

TODO: add figure that shows the representation of the cost that is
recovered for this example.

\section{Constrained DP Problem}
\subsection{Some definition}

A segmentation $m$ is described as a set of contiguous segments $\{s_1, ... s_{|m|} \}$, where $|m|$ is the number of segments of $m$
We consider the set of all segmentation up to $n$: $\M_n$ 
or the set of all possible segmentation in $k$ segments: $\M^K_n$.
We define $r_m$ as the last segment of $m$.

We aim at optimizing over all possible segmentations $m$ in $\M^K_n$ or $\M_n$
 the quantity
$\sum_{r \in m} \sum_{i \in s_{r}} \gamma(y_i, \mu_{r})$ subject to
the following $K-1$ linear constraints. 

\begin{eqnarray*}
a_{1,1}.\mu_1 + & a_{1,2}.\mu_2  & \geq  b_1 \\
... & + ... & \geq ... \\
a_{k,k}.\mu_{k} + & a_{k,k+1}.\mu_{k+1}  & \geq  b_{k} \\
... & + ... & \geq ...  \\
a_{K-1,K-1}.\mu_{K-1} +& a_{K-1,K}.\mu_K & \geq  b_{K-1},
\end{eqnarray*}

with all $a_{k,k+1} \neq 0$,  $a_{k,k} \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b_{k} \in \bar{\mathbb{R}}.$
In other word we aim at recovering the best segmentation with successive mean parameter validation the constraint.

Some examples:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If we take all $a_{k,k+1} =1$, $a_{k,k}=0$ and $b_{k} = - \infty$ we recover the standard segmentation in the mean problem.
\item If we take all $a_{k,k+1} =1$, $a_{k,k}=-1$ and $b_{k} = 0$ we recover the isotonic regression problem.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional cost representation}
To optimize this quantity we will consider the following functional quantity:

\begin{equation}
\FCC^k_t(\mu) =  \underset{m \in \M^K_n, \mu_r |  r \neq r_m}{\min} 
		\{ 
		   \underset{r \in m, r \neq r_m}{\sum} 
		   \underset{i \in r, i \leq t  }{\sum} \gamma(y_i, \mu_{r}) 
		+ 
		   \underset{i \in r_m, i \leq t}{\sum} \gamma(y_i, \mu)
		\}  
\end{equation}



\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{subject to} \\
a_{1,1}. \mu_1 + & a_{1,2}. \mu_2  & \geq  b_1 \\
... & + ... & \geq ... \\
a_{k-1,k-1}. \mu_{k-1} + &a_{k-1,k}. \mu_{k}  & \geq  b_{k-1} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

$\FCC^k_t(\mu)$ is the best possible cost achievable in $k$ segment up to point $t$ with a $k$-th
segment mean of $mu$.

\subsection{Update rule}
We can then consider the following update rule

\begin{equation}
\FCC^{k+1}_{t+1}(\mu) = \min \{ \FCC^{k+1}_{t}(\mu)  , \underset{\mu' | a_{k,k}. \mu' + a_{k,k}. \mu  \geq  b_{k}}{\min} \{ \FCC^{k}_{t}(\mu') \}  \} + \gamma(y_{t+1}, \mu)
\end{equation}

This update rule states that the best segmentation up to $t+1$ in $k+1$ segment with a last mean element of $\mu$ either has its $k$-th changepoint:
\begin{itemize}
\item before $t$ and in that case we should take the best possible segmentation up to $t$ in $k+1$
segments with a last mean of $\mu$ and then add  $\gamma(y_{t+1}, \mu)$, that is:
$$\FCC^{k+1}_{t}(\mu) + \gamma(y_{t+1}, \mu),$$

\item at $t$ and in that case we should take the best possible segmentation up to $t$ in $k$ segments
such that the last mean $\mu_k=\mu'$ validates the $k-th$ constraint with $\mu_{k+1}=\mu$ and then add  $\gamma(y_{t+1}, \mu)$, that is:
 $$\underset{\mu' | a_{k,k}. \mu' + a_{k,k}. \mu  \geq  b_{k}}{\min} \{ \FCC^{k}_{t}(\mu') \} + \gamma(y_{t+1}, \mu).$$
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Constraint}
Assuming we have a piecewise description of $\FCC^{k}_{t}(\mu')$ on $I$ ordered intervals of $\mathbb{R}$
then it is straightforward to recover the function:
$\underset{\mu' | a_{k,k}. \mu' + a_{k,k}. \mu  \geq  b_{k}}{\min} \{ \FCC^{k}_{t}(\mu') \}.$

The update rule is a priori valid for more complex constraints, typically quadratic constraints, yet recovering
$\underset{\mu' | a_{k,k}. \mu' + a_{k,k}. \mu  \geq  b_{k}}{\min} \{ \FCC^{k}_{t}(\mu') \}$ from $\FCC^{k}_{t}(\mu')$ would possibly be much more difficult.
