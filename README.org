The goal of this paper is to implement a fast algorithm for solving
the PeakSeg problem described in

- [[file:figure-constrained-PDPA-normal-real.R]] makes
  http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~thocking/figure-constrained-PDPA-normal-real/
  a data viz which shows the constrained algorithm up to 5 segments
  for a data set with 121 points.

- [[file:figure-constrained-PDPA-normal-panels.R]] implements the
  constrained PDPA algo with two kinds of min-less/min-more operators,
  inspired by two kinds of inequality constraints (strict and
  not). Visualization of running the algos up to 3 segments on 5 data
  sets with 4 data points each:

- [[file:figure-unconstrained-PDPA-normal.R]] implements the unconstrained
  PDPA and visualizes the functional cost model and pruning
